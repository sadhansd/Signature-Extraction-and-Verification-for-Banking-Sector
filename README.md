 The main aim of the proposed system is to use signature verification to enhance security in the financial environment.Our system extract handwritten signature from scanned documents using Open CV and scikit-image on python. We use connected component algorithm to extract signature from the scanned documents. Then we mathematically evaluates the similarity of scanned signature with a comparison signature. The signatures compared and the percentage of their match will be displayed on the screen. we used scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm and Siamese Network for signature verification
